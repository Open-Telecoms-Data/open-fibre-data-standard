# Open Fibre Data Standard

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Open Fibre Data Standard.

## Contributing

To contribute to the development of the standard, check out the [discussion tracker](https://github.com/Open-Telecoms-Data/open-fibre-data-standard/discussions).

## Background

The [World Bank](https://worldbank.org), the [International Telecommunications Union](https://itu.int) (ITU), [Mozilla Corporation](https://mozilla.com), the [Internet Society](https://isoc.org) (ISOC), [Liquid Intelligent Technologies](https://liquid.tech), [CSquared](https://www.csquared.com), and [Digital Council Africa](https://www.digitalcouncil.africa/) are partnering to promote the collaborative development of open data standards for describing telecommunications infrastructure. The first challenge we have taken on is that of terrestrial fibre optic infrastructure.
