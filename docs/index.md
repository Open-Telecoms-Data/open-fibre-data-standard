Open Fibre Data Standard (alpha)
==============================

Fibre optic networks are approaching the status of [essential infrastructure for a modern economy](https://manypossibilities.net/2018/05/open-telecom-data-moving-forward/). Yet, the telecom sector [lacks readily available and usable data](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1x6l-kg5y2y4wmuh3WTCbHu5Qcp7Byhip) on fibre optic network infrastructure.

The Open Fibre Data Standard (OFDS) describes:
- What data to publish about fibre optic networks in order to meet a range of use cases
- How to structure and format data for publication and use

To get an introduction to open fibre data, the data standard and the key concepts behind it, read the [primer](primer/index).

To learn how to publish and use open fibre data, read the [guidance](guidance).

For details of the OFDS data model and publication formats and for the specific rules that need to be followed to publish OFDS data, read the [reference](reference).
