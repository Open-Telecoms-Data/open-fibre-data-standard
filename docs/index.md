Fibre optic networks are approaching the status of essential infrastructure for a modern economy. Yet, the telecom sector lacks readily available and usable data on fibre optic network infrastructure.

The Open Fibre Data Standard (OFDS) describes:

- What data to publish about fibre optic networks in order to meet a range of use cases
- How to structure and format data for publication and use

To get an introduction to open fibre data, the data standard and the key concepts behind it, read the [primer](primer/index).

To learn how to publish and use open fibre data, read the [guidance](guidance/index).

For details of the OFDS data model and publication formats and for the specific rules that need to be followed to publish OFDS data, read the [reference](reference/index).

For information about changes in each version of the OFDS, read the [history](history/index)
