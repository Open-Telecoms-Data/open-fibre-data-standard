The [schema reference](schema.md) is the canonical reference for the structure of the Open Fibre Data Standard (OFDS) data model, the meaning of each field, and the rules that must be followed to publish OFDS data.

The [codelists reference](codelists.md) is the canonical reference for the meaning of the codes used to limit and standardise the possible values of fields in OFDS data.

The [publication formats reference](publication_formats.md) is the canonical reference for the formats in which OFDS can be published, and the rules for transforming OFDS data from one publication format to another.
