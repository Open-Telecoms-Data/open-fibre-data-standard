This page describes the policies and processes that govern the development of the Open Fibre Data Standard (OFDS).

## Normative and non-normative content

This section describes the normative status of content within OFDS. Content is defined by reference to the location of the source files in the [standard repository](https://github.com/Open-Telecoms-Data/open-fibre-data-standard), rather than by reference to the documentation website.

**Normative content** is the prescriptive part of a standard. It sets the rules to be followed in order to be evaluated as compliant with the standard, and from which no deviation is permitted.  The following content is normative:

* JSON schema files located in the `schema` directory, specifically `network-schema.json`
* Codelist CSV files located in the `codelists` directory and its subdirectories
* Reference markdown files located in the `docs/reference` directory and its subdirectories

**Non-normative content** is the non-prescriptive, or ‘descriptive’, part of a standard. It can include analogies, synonyms, explanations, illustrations, context, and examples. In the event non-normative content contradicts normative content, the normative content takes precedence. All content not explicitly listed above is non-normative.
