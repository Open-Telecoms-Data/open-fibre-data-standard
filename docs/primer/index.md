# Primer

In his Primer, you will find resources that cover the following topics:

- [Open Fibre Data](openfibredata) introduces open fibre data and helps to answer the question of why we might want to publish it.
- [The Open Fibre Data Standard](openfibredatastandard) (OFDS) introduces the OFDS and OFDS data, and helps to answer the question of why we might want to use the OFDS.
- [Scope and Key Concepts](scopeandkeyconcepts) introduces layers, actors and business models in fibre optic networks, and provides some definitions for key concepts in the OFDS.

Looking to learn how to publish and use open fibre data? Read the [guidance](../guidance).
