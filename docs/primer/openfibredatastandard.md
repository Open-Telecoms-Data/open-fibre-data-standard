# The Open Fibre Data Standard

## What is the Open Fibre Data Standard?

The Open Fibre Data Standard (OFDS) is a data standard for the publication of open fibre data. It describes what data to publish about fibre optic networks in order to meet a range of use cases and how to structure and format that data for publication and use.

The OFDS provides:
- A common structured data model, including a schema, codelists, definitions and rules that need to be followed.
- Publication formats to meet a range of use cases.
- Guidance and tooling to support the publication and use of data

## Why use the Open Fibre Data Standard?

Data standards resolve ambiguity by defining the structure and meaning of data. Standardised data is easier for people and systems to interpret than non-standardised data:

- Without standards, data users or intermediaries have to do the hard work of making sense of different datasets and developing dataset-specific methodologies and tools.

- With standards, users have access to information about the structure and meaning of data and can develop reusable tools and methodologies that can be applied to many different datasets.

Standards can also ensure that key information is included in a dataset. If data owners do not share key information in their data, then users need to negotiate with each data owner individually.
