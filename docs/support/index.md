This page describes how you can get help with publishing or using Open Fibre Data Standard (OFDS) data.

## OFDS Support Team

The OFDS Support Team is available to support you in publishing or using OFDS data and to assist in the ongoing development of the standard.

If you are planning to publish or use OFDS data, then the OFDS Support Team is on-hand to offer advice and input, by:

- Helping you identify approaches for converting data from your existing systems to OFDS
- Suggesting existing tools and services that can help you publish or use OFDS data
- Providing guidance on mapping your data structures to OFDS
- Giving you feedback on draft data files, and checking the structure of your data

Support is delivered in collaboration with [Open Data Services Co-operative](https://opendataservices.coop).

Through funding from the World Bank, this support is provided free of charge.

Please e-mail [openfibre@opendataservices.coop](mailto:openfibre@opendataservices.coop) with your questions, and a member of the OFDS Support Team will be in touch with you soon.
