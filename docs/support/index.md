# Getting Help

This page describes how you can get help with publishing or using Open Fibre Data Standard (OFDS) data.

## OFDS Helpdesk

The Open Fibre Data Standard (OFDS) Helpdesk is available to support you in publishing or using OFDS data, and to assist in the ongoing development of the standard.

If you are planning to publish or use OFDS data, then the OFDS Helpdesk is on-hand to offer advice and input, by:

* Helping you identify approaches for converting data from your existing systems to OFDS
* Suggesting existing tools and services that can help you publish or use OFDS data
* Providing guidance on mapping your data structures to OFDS
* Giving you feedback on draft data files, and checking the structure of your data

Helpdesk support is delivered through collaboration with [Open Data Services](https://opendataservices.coop).

Through funding from the World Bank, this support is provided free of charge.

Please e-mail [openfibre@opendataservices.coop](mailto:openfibre@opendataservices.coop) with your questions, and a member of the OFDS Helpdesk will be in touch with you soon.

## OFDS Community
