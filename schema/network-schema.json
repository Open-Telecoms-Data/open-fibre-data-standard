Longitude and latitude must be expressed using the World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS 84)[https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7946#ref-WGS84] datum in units of decimal degrees. Altitude or elevation may be included as an optional third element and must be expressed as the height in meters above or below the WGS 84 reference ellipsoid\n\nTherefore, geometries of type 'Point' must be a single array, e.g. [longitude, latitude], and geometries of type 'LineString' must be an array of arrays, e.g. [[longitude, latitude], [longitude, latitude]].",
